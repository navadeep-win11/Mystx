/**
 * Bounded depth-first search for the node that is both editable and focused.
 *
 * This is the second-stage fallback behind [AccessibilityNodeInfo.findFocus]`(FOCUS_INPUT)`:
 * `findFocus` keeps precedence (it can return container nodes upstream still accepts), and this
 * walk only runs when `findFocus` reports nothing. Some hosts expose the editable input only as
 * a deeper node that `findFocus` does not surface.
 *
 * The walk is deliberately bounded so a pathological or very deep tree cannot spike the main
 * thread: at most [NODE_BUDGET] nodes are visited and the recursion never goes deeper than
 * [MAX_DEPTH]. Every visited node is recycled on the way out — including when a node method
 * throws mid-walk — except the node returned as the match, which the caller takes ownership of.
 *
 * Must be called on the main thread. The underlying [AccessibilityNodeInfo] accessors are
 * Binder IPCs that block on the app's UI thread; calling off the main thread is unsafe and
 * violates the service's threading contract. `remaining` is per-invocation state, so concurrent
 * calls do not share mutable state, but the service already serializes calls via
 * [AssistantService.FOCUS_FALLBACK_MIN_INTERVAL_MS].
