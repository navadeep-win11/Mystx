/**
 * Catalog of the Gemini models Mystx offers and how each is tuned. Mirrors
 * [GroqModels]: each model is defined once in [SPECS] together with its thinking
 * level, and the dropdown list, default, validation, and per-model thinking
 * level all derive from that single table.
 *
 * Thinking control on Gemini 3.x is via generationConfig.thinkingConfig.thinkingLevel
 * (a string enum), kept per model here (spec-driven) rather than hardcoded in the
 * client — exactly like Groq's per-model reasoning params:
 *  - "minimal" keeps latency low for short, inline text transformations. Without
 *    it, gemini-3.6-flash defaults to "medium" thinking (~4-5s per request).
