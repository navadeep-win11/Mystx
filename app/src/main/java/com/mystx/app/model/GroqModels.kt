package com.mystx.app.model

/**
 * Single source of truth for the Groq models Mystx offers and how each one
 * is driven with respect to reasoning ("thinking").
 *
 * Each offered model is defined once in [SPECS] together with the reasoning
 * parameters it needs. The dropdown list, the default, validation, and the
 * per-model reasoning params all derive from that single table, so adding or
 * removing a model is a one-line change that forces you to state its reasoning
 * behavior right there.
 *
 * Reasoning support on Groq is per-model and strictly validated by the API:
 * sending an unsupported reasoning parameter (or an unsupported value) returns
 * HTTP 400. There are three categories:
 *
 *  1. Non-reasoning models (e.g. llama-3.1-8b-instant): must NOT receive any
 *     reasoning parameters. They never emit reasoning tokens.
 *  2. GPT-OSS models: reasoning cannot be fully disabled. Lowest is
 *     reasoning_effort="low" ("none" returns 400). include_reasoning=false hides
 *     the reasoning from the response (it is still generated internally, so this
 *     only trims what we receive/parse).
 *  3. Qwen 3.x models: reasoning can be fully turned off with
 *     reasoning_effort="none" (zero reasoning tokens). "low"/"medium"/"high"
 *     return 400 for Qwen.
